## Playing With Trucks
Here's where I'm documenting the project I'm working on for two electronics classes I'm taking at  
Piedmont Virginia Community College in Fall 2020.

### Introduction

**For ETR237**
I've created a slot car truck that
  1. Uses an ultrasonic distance sensor to determine the distance to the next corner of the track
  2. Sends that information to an Adafruit Feather microprocessor
  3. The Feather contains a program that will outputs instructions to a FeatherWing motor contol unit that
  4. Regulates the voltage to the truck motor in order to maintain the proper speed through the corner

**For ETR107**
With the same truck
  1. Use a BBC MicroBit microprocessor onboard the truck to collect and stream telemetry via radio link to another MicroBit.  Data collected includes  
    - Acceleration in two dimensions  
    - Maximum and average speed
  2. With the second MicroBit connected to a laptop, view the streamed data in realtime

**Here's a picture of the truck**
